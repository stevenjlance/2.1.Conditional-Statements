 # Conditional Statements
Conditional statements (often simply referrerd to as if statements) are a fundamental concept in all programming languages. Let's suppose we want to run a certain set of code only *if* certain conditions are met, we would write a conditional statement to achieve this!
```javascript
if(CONDITION_YOU_ARE_CHECKING) {
	// Code you want to run

}
```

For today's class, we will be practicing writing our very first conditional statements!
## Task
**CHALLENGE #1**: Draw a square that is red if the mouse's x position is less than 300, otherwise draw a blue square.

**CHALLENGE #2**: If the mouse's x position is larger than 200, draw a large square. If the mouse's x position is smaller than 200, draw a tiny square.

**CHALLENGE #3**: If mouseX is on the right side of the screen, shrink the ellipse to 20. If mouseY is on the bottom half of the screen, change the fill to red.

**CHALLENGE #4**: If mouseX is less than 100, turn the circle one color. If the mouseX is larger than

**CHALLENGE #5**: Create your own design using the following requirements:
- Create more than two variations by writing a conditional statement using the x position and y position of your mouse.
- You can change the color, size or position of a shape.`
- You can adapt a previous sketch and add interactivity to it.
